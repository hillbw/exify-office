# Exify Office
A simple Bash wrapper for [EXIficient](http://sourceforge.net/projects/exificient/) and [EXIProcessor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/exiprocessor/) to compress Office Open XML documents using [Efficient XML Interchange](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-exi-20140211/).

## Quickstart Guide

### Checkout

```
$ svn checkout https://github.com/hillbw/exify-office
```

### Change into project directory

```
$ cd exify-office
```

### Compress an included sample file:

This will begin with the file called `schedule.xlsx` in the `samples` and create a file called `schedule.xlse` ('e' for Efficient) in the same directory.

```
$ ./exify_office.sh samples/schedule.xlsx
```

### Decompress

This creates a file called `schedule_unexify.docx`, again in the samples directory.

```
$ ./unexify_office.sh samples/schedule.xlse
```

### Cleanup

To trash the extra files generated by `exify_office.sh` and `unexify_office.sh`, use the cleaner script.

```
$ ./clean_samples.sh
```

## Notes

The scripts use the following conversions for filename extensions:

| Original Extension | Exified Extension |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `.docx`            | `.doce`           |
| `.pptx`            | `.ppte`           |
| `.xlsx`            | `.xlse`           |

After a roundtrip conversion, the resulting Office file may be smaller than the original. Generally, this is because when EXIficient writes EXI out to XML, it will condense empty elements to singleton notations. Office appears to use the expanded open-tag/close-tag notation in all cases.

```xml
<!-- Original .docx format -->
<dc:description></dc:description>

<!-- After roundtrip conversion -->
<dc:description/>
```
